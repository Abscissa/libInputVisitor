libInputVisitor - ChangeLog
===========================

(Dates below are YYYY/MM/DD)

v1.2.0 - 2015/03/17
-------------------
- **Breaking change:** *Don't* take the original object as a ref parameter. That was a bad idea - it made it too easy to [accidentally escape a stack reference](https://github.com/Abscissa/SDLang-D/issues/16). Just don't forget that structs are pass-by-value, and you'll be fine. If you're using InputVisitor on a struct, and you need to access the copy of struct that's *actually* being iterated, remember that it's available as InputVisitor's ```.obj``` member.
